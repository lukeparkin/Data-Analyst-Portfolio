# Website Conversion Funnel Analysis

## Overview
This project analyses the user journey on the Cool T-Shirts website, tracking conversions from site visits → adding to cart → checkout → purchase. The aim is to identify drop-off points and calculate conversion rates to suggest improvements for better sales.

**Key Insights:**
- Largest drop-off (65%) from visits to cart – suggest making "Add to Cart" more prominent.
- Once in cart, 25% drop to checkout, 18% to purchase – overall conversion ~16%.
- Average time from visit to purchase: 44 minutes.
