# Data-Scientist-Portfolio
Welcome to my Data Scientist Portfolio!

I'm an aspiring Data Scientist based in London, passionate about transforming data into actionable business insights. Currently, I am strengthening my skills in Python and SQL with a strong focus on ML. This repository showcases my hands-on projects demonstrating key skills including:

- **Data Cleaning & Transformation** (SQL, Python)
- **Exploratory Data Analysis** (EDA)
- **Data Visualization** (Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
